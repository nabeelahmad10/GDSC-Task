  Welcome to my Pomodoro Timer project!
I'm a beginner web developer, and I'm thrilled to share this project I built to help myself and others stay focused and productive. 
I'm passionate about learning new things, and I'm a quick learner!
This Pomodoro Timer implements the popular Pomodoro Technique, which uses 25-minute work intervals separated by short breaks to promote focused work and prevent burnout.
I'm proud to say that I was able to complete 60-70% of this project independently. I researched the Pomodoro Technique, learned the core functionalities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and implemented them to create the basic structure and timer logic.
For the remaining 30-40%, I consulted various online resources and tutorials to gain insights into best practices, improve code readability, and add some finer touches. 
This collaborative learning approach has been instrumental in my development as a web developer.
I hope this Pomodoro Timer helps you stay focused and achieve your goals!
